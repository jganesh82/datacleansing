Coursera project for "Getting and cleansing data"

There are 3 files in this repository.

1. run_analysis.R - This is the R script to get the data and tidying up it.
2. CodeBook.md - This is a descriptive file which gives information about the data and the variables in which they are stored and all the transformations that the data has gone through to get tidied up.
3. clean_data.txt - This is the final output of the data after cleansing.
